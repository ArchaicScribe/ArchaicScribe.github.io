# Introduction
 "Hi, my name is Alex. I want to design and create video games that bring entertainment to millions and open the imaginations, creativity, and ideas of millions more. I am doing this with the help through Microsoft Game Studios. I utilize C#, Java, C++, and other languages to accomplish this. I would love to meet up for coffee and explore ideas on how to achieve these goals."

# Passion Project
 "The project that I am passionate about is Halo: Combat Evoloved, the video game series. I want to combine both the relevant aspects of it,through coding, mathematics, and physics to create and simulate real-life like battle scenarios. Creating characters, their stories, and the overall story arc are where the artistic and creative side will come into play. Being able to create a world in which the characters behave and act and develop in their own way is akin to watching a child grow and mature into an adult. You witness their determination, dedication, and growth all through your own eyes and world that you have created."

# Weekly Reflections
  # Week 
  Upon completion of the first week of Deep Dive Coding Bootcamp, I have discovered that coding is more than an apparatus for opening the world, and is a reflection of who you are. Coding enables the individual utilizing it to express who they are, just as an artist does with their paintbrush or an author with their words. I know that I am passionate about video games and coding allows me to work towards and strive for my goals. From learning about arrays to primitives to for loops with nested if loops are incredible to witness them in action and compile before the programmer's eyes are fantastic and inspiring to continue. You can watch your creation and ideas come to life. 
I am looking forward to learning more than I have in my first week, which is astonishing. I am sure looking back on the weeks ahead; I will be shocked to see where I started and where I have continued to progress.
