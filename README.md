# Introduction
 "Hi, my name is Alex. I want to design and create video games that bring entertainment to millions and open the imaginations, creativity, and ideas of millions more. I am doing this with the help through Microsoft Game Studios. I utilize C#, Java, C++, and other languages to accomplish this. I would love to meet up for coffee and explore ideas on how to achieve these goals."

# Passion Project
 "The project that I am passionate about is Halo: Combat Evoloved, the video game series. I want to combine both the relevant aspects of it,through coding, mathematics, and physics to create and simulate real-life like battle scenarios. Creating characters, their stories, and the overall story arc are where the artistic and creative side will come into play. Being able to create a world in which the characters behave and act and develop in their own way is akin to watching a child grow and mature into an adult. You witness their determination, dedication, and growth all through your own eyes and world that you have created."

# Quantitative Attainments

* High level of mathematics and physics
* Bachelor's degree in History with a minor in Political Science
* Can type 80-90 words a minute

# Qualitative Attainments

* People person, Gregarious/Can be caught up with people and slow progress
* Communicates clearly and effectively
* Reads and expands upon vocabulary/Can become pretentious and/or pedantic

# Portfolio

# Golden Circle
* Work on AAA video games, specifically Halo 
* Coding skills through languages such as Java, C++, C#, Python, and others.
* Create and imagine new worlds, bring joy to millions, and innovate and galvanize others to work on video games.


# Weekly Reflections
  # Week 1 Reflection
  Upon completion of the first week of Deep Dive Coding Bootcamp, I have discovered that coding is more than an apparatus for opening the world, and is a reflection of who you are. Coding enables the individual utilizing it to express who they are, just as an artist does with their paintbrush or an author with their words. I know that I am passionate about video games and coding allows me to work towards and strive for my goals. From learning about arrays to primitives to for loops with nested if loops are incredible to witness them in action and compile before the programmer's eyes are fantastic and inspiring to continue. You can watch your creation and ideas come to life. 
I am looking forward to learning more than I have in my first week, which is astonishing. I am sure looking back on the weeks ahead; I will be shocked to see where I started and where I have continued to progress.

# Three Years Later

"The two images above represent my life, from the current status to three years in the future. The first one reminded me of a construction site for a new building, having the blocks, tools, and other necessary items to accomplish the task. Even though this will take time to erect the building, all of the components are there, and I have to go through the work to accomplish this task. The second picture represents accomplishing my goal, by not only erecting one building, but an entire city. The other buildings represent other certifications, skills, languages that I will pick up along the way to accomplishing my goal. I have a strong affinity to the ocean, and I will be living near one, ideally in either Boston or Seattle. Both cities signify that I have made it to my desired destination." 

# Week 2 Reflections
In week 2, we explored more keywords such as "this, enum, multidimensional arrays" and much more. We went through a plethora of examples of coding and utilizing the lessons we learned. I was definitely challenged this week, especially during Wednesday's Android project. Then Thursday came around, working on the War Game and it began to click more than before. After reading the book, practicing and watching a myriad of videos and tutorials, which helped tremendously. This class is a massive challenge, but it is an undertaking that I am looking forward to completing.

# Two Organizations with site recommendations

The name of the first organization I selected is Tour New Mexico. My reasons for choosing this specific site are the UI needs to be significantly overhauled. Some of the hyperlinks look very inaesthetic and appears not to have been updated in many years. The pictures they have do not seem to be of taken by their photographer and ripped off of other people's social media sites. Then for their tour schedule photos, they have pictures from Arizona and possibly one from New Mexico. This portion of the site is not a great representation of New Mexico and should have photos of the Land of Enchantment. Their hamburger menu is a nice touch, but the site overall is slim and lacking information, and the UI needs to be more interactive. 

My strategy for reaching this person(s) would be a phone call, informing them that I have seen their website and had some suggestions to enhance their site.  I would strongly suggest redoing their UI portion of the site, acquire photos of New Mexico to showcase the state, update their logo and banner as well. The contact us section is antiquated and scarce; there is also a huge market for an app as well that they could capitalize and monetize and are missing a massive audience of tourism.
